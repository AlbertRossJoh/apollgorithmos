\problemname{Apollgorithmos}
In a whimsical realm called Algorea, the god Apollgorithmos, master of algorithms and patterns, reigned supreme. He loved the beauty of combining base elements using magical Recipes of Creation to form wondrous new entities.\\
One day, Apollgorithmos issued a grand challenge to the cleverest minds in the multiverse: take a collection of base elements and use the Recipes of Creation to craft new elements that would enhance the harmony of Algorea.\\

As one of the chosen, you stand before the divine altar with shimmering elements and glowing recipes. Your task is to combine these elements creatively and efficiently, ensuring each new creation adds to the balance and beauty of Algorea.\\
Embrace the challenge with wit and wisdom, guided by the playful spirit of Apollgorithmos. May your algorithms be elegant and your creations brilliant!
\section*{Input}
The input starts with the number of base elements \(n\), followed by a line containing \(n\) elements. After this, there will be the number of recipes \(m\), followed by \(m\) lines in the format: \(a\;b\;c\), where combining \(a\) and \(b\) gives element \(c\).\\
After \(m\) lines, you will receive the goal element.
\section*{Output}
The output should be the amount of steps required to create the desired element from the given base elements using the provided recipes.
